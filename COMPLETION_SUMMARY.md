## ✅ **Phase 3: COMPLETED - Workflow Examples (1 day)**

### **📍 Address Lookup + AI Context - IMPLEMENTED**
```go
// Example: "Look up zipcode 01310-100 and tell me about the area"
// Result: Address → Avenida Paulista → Historical context from AI
```

### **🔍 Multi-Provider Research - IMPLEMENTED**
```go
// Example: "Ask different AIs about machine learning trends"
// Result: OpenAI (current trends) + Gemini (Google perspective) + Mistral (open-source view)
```

### **⚖️ Decision-Making Workflows - IMPLEMENTED**
```go
// Example: "Plan a São Paulo visit"
// Result: Address lookup → Claude (attractions) → OpenAI (restaurants) → Mistral (transportation)
```
